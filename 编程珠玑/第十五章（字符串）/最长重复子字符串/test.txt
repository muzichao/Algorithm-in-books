Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of 
Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, 
with ¡°the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions 
of dreary space,¡ªthat reservoir of frost and snow, where firm 
fields of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in 
Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre 
the multiplied rigours of extreme cold.¡± Of these death-white 
realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-
comprehended notions that float dim through children¡¯s brains, 
but strangely impressive. The words in these introductory pages 
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave 
significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and 
spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold 
and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just 
sinking.
